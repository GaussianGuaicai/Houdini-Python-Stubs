Procedurals to generate python type stubs for hou and pdg module.

Change environment variables 'HFS' and 'HHP', and run this script to generate PDG stubs.

```

Change environment variables 'HFS' and run this script to generate hou stubs.
I copy this script from [cg-stubs](https://github.com/LumaPictures/cg-stubs) and made some changes, thanks their great work again.
